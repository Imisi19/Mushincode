        <H4>first, policy inefficiency, has been examined using each of the three pillars of political economy analysis. The theory of collective action rests on the hypothesis that organized groups of voters apply more pressure on politicians than unorganized groups. This theory explains systematic policy failure in developing countries if special interests in poor countries are particularly well-organized and antagonistic to broader development objectives. The second pillar focuses on the institutions that structure how politicians gain and retain power and who can propose or must approve policy change. This explains development if the formal institutions of poor countries yield greater inefficiencies in policy making than formal institutions in rich countries.Finally, policy distortions may be driven by imperfections in political markets, including the lack of voter information; the lack of credibility of pre-electoral political promises; the “all or nothing” nature of many political choices (such as the need to choose a single candidate to represent voter interests on multiple dimensions); and the extent of polarization in the electorate across politically relevant dimensions. If these imperfections are more pronounced in less developed countries, they can explain differential development outcomes</H4>
    
           <p id="lower">inability to make credible commitments – handcuffs governments in numerous ways, from monetary policy to their ability to encourage investment. The literature here is more recent, but tends to focus as well on the relative size and power of economic interests in a country, formal institutions, particularly the extent of political checks and balances and the voting franchise, and political market imperfections, particularly the inability of politicians to make credible pre-electoral promises. Researchers in this area, more than in any other, attempt to explain divergent experiences of economic development, and argue explicitly that governments in poor countries are less able to make credible commitments.
This review sidesteps discussion of the determinants of policy efficiency in autocracies, simply because the literature on the political economy of democracies is far more advanced.


Variations in government performance and economic development
Countries exhibit enormous variation both with respect to their policy choices and their credibility. With respect to policy efficiency, taking into account per capita income, average secondary school enrollment in 154 countries in 1995 varied more than 100 percentage points from the minimum to the maximum.3 Enrollments in the top 25 percent of countries were more than 34 percent higher than the bottom 25 percent. One commonly used measure of credibility is an indicator of the rule of law. On a six point scale, again controlling for per capita income, the lowest scoring 25 percent of countries scored more than one point below the best performing quartile.
Similarly, the most corrupt quartile of countries was more than 1.5 points more corrupt than the least corrupt quartile, again on a six point scale.4. Taking policy and credibility failures together, it is not surprising that from 1975 to 2000, income per capita in the fastest growing quartile of countries grew more than two percentage points per year faster than in the slowest growing quartile – a difference that, by the year 2000, meant that the incomes per capita in the slower growing quartile were more than 60 percent less than they otherwise would have been.5
One could argue that these discrepancies, even controlling for income, are outside government control. Many factors enter into school enrollments that are unrelated to government policy; this is even truer with respect to growth.
However, again controlling for income per capita, the top quartile of countries spent more than 7 percentage points more on education, as a fraction of total government spending, than the lowest spending quartile.6. It may not be surprising; therefore, that if one simply correlates growth across countries and asks how poor countries are doing relative to rich countries, one finds that divergence between the two groups is increasing (Pritchett 1997). These differences are a core puzzle of the social sciences.
3.	EXAMINE INTERNATIONAL AND FACTORS THAT IMPAIR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
International organizations are important actors in the critical episodes of international politics, with power in mediation, dispute resolution, peacekeeping, applying sanctions and others. They also help in managing various key areas of international concern, from global health policy to the monetary policies around the world (Abbott and Snidal, 1998).
An international organizations can be defined as ‘an institutional agreement between members of an international system in order to achieve objectives according to systemic conditions, reflecting attributes, aspirations and concerns of its members’ (Hanrieder, 1966). And what gives the basic rule of them is the sovereignty of the nation-state (Barkin and Cronin, 2009).
In terms of the concept of global governance promoted by the international organizations, this was originally based on raw power, but has evolved to legitimacy and customs</p><br>

            <article>We proceed with a discussion of thecosts of censorship, and suggest how do these costs might result in a slower pace of technological development and potential political turbulence. We assume that isolationism reduces the level of technological diffusion,and,asaconsequence,thespeedoftechnologicaldevelopment,aswellasoutput growth,becomelower. Asaresultoflowgrowthrates,asubstantialpartofpopulation can stay comparatively poor and therefore sensitive to negative shocks which might potentially hit the economy. As a consequence of such a shock incomes can end up fallingbelowaparticularminimalthreshold,whichmightresultinpoliticalunrestand a regime change.
